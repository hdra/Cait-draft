#About

This is the static HTML design draft for the [Cait][l1] theme.
Some stuffs have changed since converting it to a Pelican theme,
but most of structures and design are pretty much the same.

#Usage

Feel free to use the design and/or the code if you want to port
the theme to other blogging engine, or any other purposes, really.
