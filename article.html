                                <p>It has been a few weeks since I decided to start blogging again, but well, as usual not
                                much has been done on it.
                                For starter, I initially planned to host it on Heroku, following the tricks outline <a href="http://kennethreitz.org/exposures/static-sites-on-heroku-cedar">here</a>,
                                and it is super simple to setup. I had created a new Heroku app, generated the blog, and pushed
                                the generated content to Heroku in just a few minutes. In another minute, and I had setup the
                                custom domain and had everything working nicely. </p>
                                <blockquote>

                                <p>Problem is, even though the site itself is just a bunch of static files, the first time I visited
                                the site, it took a few seconds to load the content, but when I visit it again for the second time,
                                it served the site almost immediately. At first, I thought it was because of the site is cached by
                                the browser, so it loads much quicker, but even when I cleared the browser cache, it still loads the
                                same way. After a bit of googling, I <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos">found</a> out that Heroku will turn off the dyno after an
                                hour of inactivity, so everytime I visit the site after a period of idling, the dyno will need to
                                be started again at that time. Not much of a problem, considering I am not even paying for the
                                amazing service that Heroku provide, and there <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5480337/easy-way-to-prevent-heroku-idling">ways</a> to get around it anyway. I probably won't
                                be using it, since I am still playing around with the hosting options around anyway.</p>
                                <h2>This is subheading 2</h2>
                                <p>Other popular service that people use to host their static site seems to be <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. After
                                looking around on how to set it up, seems like it is pretty easy to set it up. The Pelican makefile
                                even includes a build option for this setup. The site will be hosted in a repository just like any
                                other git repo, but the site index will need to be on the <code>gh-pages</code> branch. In other words, the
                                content of the site will be open source. Not a problem though, since any webpage that are publicly
                                accessible are basically open source anyway. Maybe I'll move the site here after I am done setting
                                the website itself.</p>
                                <h3>This is subheading 3</h3>
                                <p>On building the site itself, I just converted some of my old wordpress posts to Markdown, which
                                should be published along with this post. The automatic converter doesn't work too well, since many
                                of posts contains some really badly formed markups, so I ended up manually converting the most of
                                posts. I also took the chance to just remove many of the rants/silly posts, not saying that there
                                aren't any silly posts left anyway.</p>

                                <p>I am still playing around with the pelican configurations and options, on how to setup different
                                static pages, building a theme, etc. Speaking about the theme, I drafted a theme of my own.</p>
                                <p><img alt="Screenshot of the WIP theme" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8394/8615163439_30ea63f405.jpg" /></p>
                                <p>Initially I liked it quite a bit, but after leaving it there for a few days, when I came back to
                                work on it again, I found it to be not very attractive anymore. So, no need to say, I scrapped it,
                                and started working from scratch. This time, planning the overall sites, starting from the landing
                                page, static pages, comments, and of course the blog itself. Of course, it won't be around anytime
                                soon. For the time being, the default Pelican theme seems more than good enough for me.</p>
